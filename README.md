## Usage and Basic setup
This is a calendar widget plugin for online web applications.  By segregating the individual functionalities and taking advantage of a grunt build system, it is easy for you to customize and integrate this calendar for your website!  Or you can use our pre-built controller and stylesheets as well from the distribution folder.  These files are compiled and ready to go for use! <br> If you have questions, comments, or concerns regarding this application please contact [Nathan Brophy](mailto:broph035@umn.edu)
